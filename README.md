# Building-an-RFM-Recency-Frequency-Monetary-segmentation-model
RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as

    • Recency – How recently did the customer purchase our products? 
    • Frequency – How often do they make the purchase? 
    • Monetary Value – How much do they averagely spend per purchase? 

Goal of the project:
1. Select the best 500 customers amongst the 4000 customers to maximize subscriptions to the loyalty program

2. To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data which should include the following:
    • a unique customer id
    • date of transaction/order
    • transaction/order amount
