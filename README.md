# Building-an-RFM-Recency-Frequency-Monetary-segmentation-model

RFM segmentation enables marketers to target specific groups of consumers with communications that are far more relevant to their individual behaviours, resulting in much greater response rates and improved loyalty and customer lifetime value. RFM segmentation, like other segmentation approaches, is an effective tool to identify groups of consumers who should be treated differently. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary

RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as

    • Recency – How recently did the customer purchase our products? 
    • Frequency – How often do they make the purchase? 
    • Monetary Value – How much do they averagely spend per purchase? 

Goal of the project:

1. Select the best 500 customers amongst the 4000 customers to maximize subscriptions to the loyalty program

2. To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data which should include the following:

    • a unique customer id
   
    • date of transaction/order
    
    • transaction/order amount
    
    
    
    
    
Benefits of this analysis:

    • After designing a solution on top customers provided by us, will help client to increase their customer spend and increase customer lifetime value
    
    • Analysis of Important customer base provided to the client, will help to build meaningful relationships with their existing clients 
    
    • Developed model will help client in witnessing increase in partnering businesses and overall brand awareness
    
    • By implementing a loyalty program on top customers will also help to attract other new users
